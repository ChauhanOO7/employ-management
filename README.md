2. Install Dependencies: If the application has dependencies listed in a package.json file,run npm install to install them.

3. Start the Application: Run the Node.js application.

    Common commands include npm start, node app.js, or a custom script defined in the package.json file.

4. Access the Application: Once the application is running, open a web browser and go to

http://localhost:port

where is the port number on which your application is running.

The port number is typically specified in the application's configuration or output when starting the server.

b. Frontend: Now start Frontend.

Steps:

1. Navigate to the Project Directory: Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where your React application is located.

2. Install Dependencies: If the application has dependencies listed in a package.json file, run npm install to install them.

3. Use npm or yarn to install the project dependencies.

 npm install

 or

 yarn install
4. Start the Development Server: After installing dependencies, you can start the development server.

npm start

This command starts the development server and opens your default web browser to display the React application. If it doesn't open automatically, you can
navigate to

in your browser.

That's it! You now have your MERN application running locally on your system.
